# UST-TAD (University of Stuttgart - Technology-Agnostic Deployments)

This project originates from the Master's Thesis of Marcel Weller at University of Stuttgart in 2021/2022.
The title of the Master's Thesis is "Transformation of Technology-specific Deployment Models into Technology-Agnostic Deployment Models".
It mainly provides a concept for a transformation framework capable of such a transformation.
This GitHub project contains a prototypical realization of the transformation framework.

Find the Master's Thesis document in this repository.
Chapter 4 contains a description of the implementation of the prototypical realization and gives an overview about the different services that relate to the repositories that you can find here.

The transformation framework can be deployed with the docker-compose scripts in https://github.com/UST-TAD/deployment-config
